Contract Scope:
- Gartner Research Services renewal for Singapore Government technology stakeholders covering GT and SNDGO segments.

Usage & Engagement Highlights:
- Average 326 total interactions per month over 20 months with a 23% growth trend and peak activity around budget cycles (Sep 2023, Mar 2024).
- Power users such as Ace Tan sustain 91 interactions per month; top 5 users show consistent engagement.
- Analyst access remains critical with 306 total calls (~15 calls/month) and 48 conference participations (~2.4 sessions/month), indicating value beyond report downloads.

Cost & Budget Position:
- Contract currently tracking at $3.9M actual spend versus $3.5M contracted (11% over budget) midway through a 36-month term.
- GT segment: $2.8M contracted vs $3.1M actual (+$300K / 11% over) with 4,938 downloads at ~$632 per download.
- SNDGO segment: $0.7M contracted vs $0.8M actual (+$100K / 14% over) with 1,232 downloads at ~$649 per download.
- Overall cost per download sits near $632 (from $3.9M across 6,170 downloads) with projected final cost of ~$7.02M if current pace holds.

User Sentiment & Value:
- Survey data: 76% rate Gartner as valuable; 69% support an optimised renewal; 31% express interest in alternatives primarily due to cost.
- Overall ROI observed at approximately 4.2:1 with 78% user satisfaction and strong reliance on Magic Quadrants, Market Guides, and analyst interactions.

Optimisation Strategy:
- Recommended tiered access model: Premium (5 users), Standard (8), Basic (10), Remove (15 low-use) delivering ~$1.2M annual savings.
- Broader right-sizing objective reduces active seats to ~620 from current allocations, targeting $420K annual savings and $707K total savings over the contract period.
- Negotiation levers include an 8% volume discount on 2-year commitments, Â±10% annual seat adjustment flexibility, SLA-backed performance credits, and 3% cap on price increases, together worth ~$287K additional savings.

Alternatives & Recommendation:
- Forrester offers potential 15% cost reduction (~$360K savings) but introduces a six-month transition risk.
- Hybrid model pairing Gartner (IT/Strategy, 400 seats) with Forrester (Marketing/CX, 200 seats) could trim costs by ~12% while increasing vendor management complexity.
- Executive recommendation: proceed with an optimised 2-year Gartner renewal, maintain critical analyst access, and implement the tiered seat strategy to lock in savings while supporting core missions.
